The Reaction Timer System is a hardware-based project designed to measure the reaction times of
two players and determine a winner based on their performances. The system utilizes an FSM-based
controller to manage the state transitions and handle the timing and scoring logic. The project is
implemented using VHDL and targets FPGA devices.
